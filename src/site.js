/**
 * this could be my 'router' configuration - mapping what the output (urls = files on the system) to the js functions that
 * generate them. Also it should map dependencies so we can be sure to only rebuild the parts of the site that we need. 
 *
 * For the time being (v 0.0.0) I am not using this configuration, while I go about experimenting with specific build files
 * - this will come into play when i put it all together and make it robust/configurable/reusable.
