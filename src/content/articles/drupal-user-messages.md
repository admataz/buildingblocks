A "Messages of Support" module for Drupal
==========================================

The Elders work across a range of global issues which evoke expressions of support from people affected by their work. We wanted a way to capture these expressions and allow people to share them with other users of the site. 

## The authenticity of anonymous contributors. 
It was clear from the start that moderation would be a requirement. Opening a site like The Elders' to public contribution is potentially inviting vitriol and 

- moderation
- barriers to contribution (image upload)

### Implementation of the Add Message functionality
- Making Drupal'a "add node" form available on public interface
- as a modal window
- with an image upload and crop facility
- and ajax processing
- a preview for the user 
- that is embeddable on any page 
- and implicitly records the site context of the message to match it to the relevant topic.

### Implementation of the Message display functionality. 

## Technologies used
Drupal Forms, Drupal JavaScript Behaviours, PHP, JavaScript, Backbone.js, JCrop
