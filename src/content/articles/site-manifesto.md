# the new, new admataz website manifesto

I originally wrote this in 2011 for a previous version of admataz.com - to keep my efforts on track. Reviewing it now (2015), while admataz has grown into a more formal business entity and I am working more directly with clients as opposed to a freelance contractor -   I think it is still relevant to my approach to this site. 


### This is my web site, and hereâ€™s the thinking behind it:

1. **Original**. The site reflects and records my ongoing ideas, expressions and professional work. This means regular subjective updates to the site content.

1. **Experimental**. The site code is created by me, using self-made tools over libraries and frameworks where I can. My personal site is an opportunity for learning, experimentation with my craft and developing core skills. This means regular unstable additions to the site functionality. 

1. **Minimal and progressive**. The site design, features and technology only contain what is needed. This means less structure, navigation and technical capacity. It also means less bloat. 

1. **Open**. When I produce original code for this site, I expose it, explain it and share it. 

1. **Incomplete**. It's never finished because there's always space for growth and new ideas.

1. **Mine**. I am not a client or employer. I can do what I like, break the rules and be inefficient.
