## More than code and process.
While all web sites are constructed with the core mechanics of code and data, the world wide web is a living, networked platform for people, ideas and culture. This understanding of people-centredness is core to my approach to technical implementation. I use PHP, JavaScript and a range of open web technologies and frameworks to make websites that are for people to click.
