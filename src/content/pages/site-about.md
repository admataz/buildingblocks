admataz.com is my personal and business portfolio website. It's an ongoing project where I experiment with code, design and words. It has been through many different versions and for what itâ€™s worth, there's a [site manifesto](/articles/site-manifesto). This site is powered by BuildingBlocks, a minimal and experimental open source static site publishing system I wrote in using node.js. You can read more about the project [here](#).
