## Web Developer, Technical Lead, Technologist
I am a full stack web developer with over 15 years professional experience. I am equally comfortable developing RESTful web services and content management tools as I am happy programming client-side web applications and interfaces for desktop and mobile. I am familiar with web standards across the tiers and have a continually growing knowledge of a range of open source languages, tools, libraries, frameworks and applications that help deliver the end product to the user. Over the years I have extended myself to interaction design, information architecture, education, game design, business strategy and project management, but at the core has always been the mechanics of web technologies: code, data and people. I love the web: to a technologist like me it is a giant puzzle and playground. And as a platform for people, ideas and culture, it is my passion.

## Profile
I find inspiration in the diversity of people around me. London has always been great for that. Now as dad to two great small kids, I love the games, toys, play and adventures we have around town. I graduated as an environmental and geographical scientist in 1995, and I continue to visualise interactive systems as spatial entities for human interaction. The continually evolving and emergent relationships between people, culture, location and technology are what got me excited about digital media in the first place, and still today I am not disappointed.
