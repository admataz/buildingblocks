## The Elders web site

> [The Elders](http://theelders.org) are independent global leaders, brought together by Nelson Mandela, who offer their collective influence and experience to support peace building, help address major causes of human suffering and promote the shared interests of humanity.

Since 2010 I have been working closely with the digital communications team at The Elders, developing and maintaining their website at [TheElders.org](http://theelders.org). The website reflects their ongoing global initiatives and activities, and provides an historical depth of information for visitors to find out more about the individuals and the organisation. 

In late 2014 we launched a new version of the site, building on the successful design and architecture we had developed in earlier iterations.  This new version was an upgrade from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7, and included a fresh custom theme with mobile responsiveness. We improved the UX of the site and provided a range of CMS tools to better manage the diverse content.
