## Marie Stopes International data visualisations
> Evidence is an integral part of our programmes in helping us to improve how we deliver our services, to assess the feasibility of reaching more under-served people, and gather evidence to support advocacy and policy for family planning. 

In 2012 admataz developed a series of data visualisations to help [Marie Stopes International](http://mariestopes.org) communicate the effectiveness of their services and ongoing programmes. 

We also created a set of tools that would allow them to uploadi CSV data and publish common chart visualisations from their Drupal-based CMS.
