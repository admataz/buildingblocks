## Topshop quiz
After the success of the quiz admataz developed for the [Kate Moss campaign in 2014](http://www.topshop.com/en/tsuk/category/kate-moss-x-topshop-the-icon-is-back-30042014-2834606/home?TS=1396356314294), the digital team at Topshop were keen to repeat the success with a similar quiz in their [2015 online magazine](http://www.topshop.com/en/tsuk/category/magazine-3933384/home). Topshop commissioned a new quiz, dubbed “[What’s your Tribe](http://www.topshop.com/en/tsuk/category/topshop-magazine-2663381/whats-your-tribe-4173133?intcmpid=Zine_Shop_Quiz)” to provide a fun way for users to browse the themed trends for the season.
