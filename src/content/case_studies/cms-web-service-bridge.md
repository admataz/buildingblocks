## CMS tools for Drupal-to-web-service push
We recently developed a set of CMS tools that provide integration between a [Drupal](http://drupal.org) CMS and a [node.js](http://nodejs.org) backed RESTful web service, primarily for mobile web apps. These tools allow editors to work in Drupal's established and familiar admin interface, with Drupal's full array of tools for managing Content Types and Fields -  and publish to static JSON or [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) collections for consumption by mobile apps.
