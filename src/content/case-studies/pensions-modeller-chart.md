Pensions Modeller and chart using dojo.js charting
==================================================

- Dojo charts
- encapsulating JS 
- loading dojo with require (but not building)
- Dojo build process - extracting what is needed using Grunt build
- the client isn't always right - keeping cool
- sometimes you are wrong (too many files in the commit)
- confidence in unit tests
